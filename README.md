# Chaos Monkey Network Tool

**Chaos Monkey** is a robust network testing tool designed to simulate network disruptions and test the resilience of network infrastructure. Through randomized network interface toggling, latency injection, and network surges, Chaos Monkey ensures your systems are prepared for unexpected failures. Designed for virtual environments like vSRX routers, it provides powerful, automated stress testing in real-time.

## Features

- **Randomized Interface Disruptions:** Disable and re-enable network interfaces (`ge-`) at random, simulating network instability.
- **Latency Injection:** Introduce random latency (between 50ms to 500ms) to specific interfaces to mimic real-world network delays.
- **Network Surges:** Generate network traffic surges on selected interfaces, putting additional load on your network.
- **Interface Protection:** A specific interface (e.g., `ge-0/0/1`) is protected from disruptions, ensuring critical network paths remain intact during tests.
- **Configurable Parameters:** Easily adjust the time between actions and control which interfaces are protected.
- **Graceful Cleanup:** On termination, Chaos Monkey restores all modified interfaces to their original, active state.

## How It Works

Chaos Monkey randomly selects devices from your network configuration and performs one of the following actions on their interfaces:

- **Disable Interface:** Temporarily disables a selected `ge-` interface to simulate network failure.
- **Inject Latency:** Adds artificial latency to simulate network delays on the interface.
- **Create Network Surge:** Generates a surge of traffic on an interface to test how it handles high load.

After performing these actions, the interface is restored, ensuring no lasting disruption. The tool repeats the process continuously until manually stopped.

## Installation

Chaos Monkey requires Python 3.x and the Junos PyEZ library for communicating with network devices.

### From Source

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chaos-monkey.git
   cd chaos-monkey
   ```

2. Install the required Python dependencies:

   ```bash
   python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Create your configuration file:

   ```yaml
   # devices_config.yaml
   credentials:
     username: "your_username"
     password: "your_password"

   devices:
     vSRX1:
       ip: "192.168.255.2"
       interfaces:
         - "ge-0/0/0"
         - "ge-0/0/1"
         - "ge-0/0/2"
     vSRX2:
       ip: "192.168.255.3"
       interfaces:
         - "ge-0/0/0"
         - "ge-0/0/1"
         - "ge-0/0/2"
     vSRX3:
       ip: "192.168.255.4"
       interfaces:
         - "ge-0/0/0"
         - "ge-0/0/1"
         - "ge-0/0/2"
         - "ge-0/0/3"
     vSRX4:
       ip: "192.168.255.5"
       interfaces:
         - "ge-0/0/0"
         - "ge-0/0/1"
         - "ge-0/0/2"
   ```

4. Run Chaos Monkey:

   ```bash
   python3 chaos_main.py
   ```

## Configuration

Chaos Monkey is highly configurable through a YAML file (`devices_config.yaml`) and Python variables.

### YAML Configuration

The YAML file defines the devices and their interfaces to be managed by Chaos Monkey. Each device must include:

- **IP Address**: The IP of the device.
- **Interfaces**: A list of interfaces (`ge-0/0/x`) that Chaos Monkey will act upon.

### Python Variables

You can modify the behavior of Chaos Monkey by changing the following variables in the script:

- **`SLEEP_TIME_MIN` and `SLEEP_TIME_MAX`**: Controls the range for how long Chaos Monkey waits between actions.
- **`AVOID_INTERFACE`**: Specifies an interface to protect (e.g., `ge-0/0/1`), which Chaos Monkey will not disable or disrupt.

## Example

Here’s a quick example of Chaos Monkey in action:

```python
[INFO] Connected to device 192.168.255.1
[ACTION] Disabling ge-0/0/2 on vSRX1
[RESULT] ge-0/0/2 on vSRX1 disabled
[WAIT] Waiting for 12.43 seconds before re-enabling ge-0/0/2...
[ACTION] Enabling ge-0/0/2 on vSRX1
[RESULT] ge-0/0/2 on vSRX1 enabled
[WAIT] Sleeping for 9.21 seconds before the next action...
```

Upon pressing `Ctrl+C`, Chaos Monkey gracefully restores all modified interfaces:

```python
[INFO] Chaos Monkey stopped by user.
[INFO] Enabling all modified interfaces...
[ACTION] Re-enabling ge-0/0/2 on vSRX1
[INFO] All modified interfaces enabled.
```

   ```bash
   python3 -m pip install -r requirements-test.txt
   ```

2. Run tests:

   ```bash
   python3 -m pytest tests/
   ```
